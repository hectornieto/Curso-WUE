    "When a soil water deficit at the root-zone occurs, the typical physiological response of plants is to close partially or totally their stomata, with the aim of avoiding significant losses of water.

    "Firstly, since heat is exchanged less efficiently than momentum, we need to correctly define the aerodynamic roughness length for heat transport ($z_0H$), and, indeed, the relationship $z_{0H} \\approx 0.1 z_{0M}$ might not be valid for all types of surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, the radiometric surface temperature can significantly change depending on the observation viewing angle. This is particularly relevant for Earth observation sensors with a wide field of view or wide swath, such as Sentinel-3 SLSTR, with view zenith angles ranging from nadir ($VZA = 0$º) up to VZAs of 50º or 60º. This is important since the sensor might see a different proportion of (cool) vegetation and (warm) soil. Indeed, we saw in the previous exercise that the canopy transmittance depends on the canopy density, the leaf angle distribution, and the incidence/illumination angle. This effect is perfectly reciprocal when we deal with the sensor geometry instead of the solar geometry.\n",

    "The interactive plot below demonstrates this effect. You can define the sensor's view zenith angle as well as the dominant leaf inclination angle.

The final objective of this session is to introduce you the most relevant physical processes that determine ET, with the hope that you could form a critical understanding, allowing you to decide which model to use for your specific requirements and with the data/products which you have available**.
